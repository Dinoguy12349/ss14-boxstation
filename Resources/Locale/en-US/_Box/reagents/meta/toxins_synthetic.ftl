reagent-name-zip-bomb = ZIP bomb
reagent-desc-zip-bomb = A malicious nanite software that forces synthetic lifeforms to process a large amount of data, at the cost of processing vital systems. It also causes the components of synthetic lifeforms to overheat.

reagent-name-cih = CIH
reagent-desc-cih = A resurrection of an ancient computer virus. It causes mass destruction to vital systems in synthetic lifeforms, and often leads to damage to their hardware.

reagent-name-bootloop = bootloop
reagent-desc-bootloop = A nanite software that forces a synthetic lifeform to rapidly restart, causing a slowdown in their function. At high enough concentrations, it prevents synthetic lifeforms from starting back up properly. Often used as a sedative.
